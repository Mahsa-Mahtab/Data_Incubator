It has been more than two years in global scale that the world is dealing with the ongoing COVID pandemic. Some countries were affected more than others, and this was the result of many combined factors such as country population and demographic, quarantine restrictions strategies, border controls and so forth. On  Monday, November 09, 2020, Pfizer and BioNTech announced the very first effective vaccine with more than 90% protection based on their preliminary analysis. However, it took several weeks to months for the vaccination process to be established in different countries and more months to see the downward trend in COVID rate. In early summer 2021, many countries started to remove COVID restrictions gradually and one of those were school opening for this fall.  In this project, my goal was to investigate the effect of removing restrictions on COVID rate; specifically, the school opening.
